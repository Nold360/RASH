-- About
RASH is a combination of scripts, which allow to start/stop a daemon (called service) 
on a remote host using SSH. 
To do so, RASH has to be installed and configured on all Hosts and Clients.

-- Configuration
--- /etc/rash/rash.conf
General configuration, f.e. which Username is used, how big the timeouts are
or if you which to start RASH at all.

--- /etc/rash/services.allowed
List of all services, which are allowed to be startet locally from a remote host.

--- /etc/rash/services.conf
Configuration for the commbination of remote host and services to be started/stopped
if you call "rashcmd.sh" or "/etc/init.d/rash"

NOTICE: A service name is allways the name of an init-script located under /etc/init.d !!

-- Starten der Dienste
--- /etc/init.d/rash
Init-script which startes/stoppes the remote services configured in /etc/rash/services.conf.

NOTICE: You may want to add your local service, which the remote services depend on (f.e. a database)
to the end of the "Required-Start:" line!
If you don't do so, your Services might not start on bootup!

--- /etc/init.d/rash_watchdog
The Watchdog has to be running on the System, which is waiting for an incomming command to 
start/stop a service. He also anseres the request by sending a status back to the requesting host.
Also it can be configured to test remote services using netcat (see /etc/rash/rash.conf)
